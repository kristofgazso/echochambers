    "Echochambers are the usually most vilifying and useless form of communities. Little critical thinking is invested into the ideas circulated beyond the justification of already held beliefs, and any conflicting ideas are usually ridiculed or just ignored at worst. Platforms like Twitter and Reddit provide safe haven for a many echochambers on the internet as they make it incredibly easy to become intrenched in certain communities (like subreddits or twitter sub-cultures).\n",

    "Here I attempt to model some of the behaviours of echochambers: simply at first, then building up complexity. I will see if I can find some non-intuitive and interesting conclusions while doing so.\n",

    "A lot of the initial modelling will come from Frank Witte's ECON0055 Economics of Science lectures\n",

    "NOTE: the models created here are just that: models. There is a lot of oversimplification that happens when creating them and they shouldn't be treated as 100% accurate in predicting human behaviour."
